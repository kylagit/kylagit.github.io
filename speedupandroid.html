<h2>How to speed up a slow Android device</h2>
<h3>1. Uninstall/disable apps (Even built-in ones!) that you don't need</h3>
<p>Most Android devices come with lots of built-in apps that take up storage, update themselves and send spam notifications without you even using them!</a></p>
<p>To uninstall/disable the apps you don't need, go to Settings > Apps > Choose an app that you don't need, then click Uninstall/disable and accept the warning</a></p>
<p>If you uninstalled, that was it!, if you diabled, you'll need to click the three dots in the top right corner then click "Uninstall updates" to free the storage space</a></p>
<p>Then restart your phone, you will notice a massive amount of storage freed, and significant improvements to speed and battery life</a></p>
